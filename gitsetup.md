To set up a GitHub remote repository and credentials on your Mac, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Git (if not already installed):
   If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official website or install it using Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install git
   ```

2. Configure Git with your name and email:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. Generate an SSH key (if you don't already have one):
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   Press Enter to accept the default file location and optionally set a passphrase.

4. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

5. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
   ```
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

6. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to GitHub.com and sign in
   - Click on your profile picture > Settings > SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key and give it a descriptive title

7. Test your SSH connection:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   You should see a message confirming your authentication.

8. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub.com and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Follow the prompts to create your repository

9. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

10. Navigate into the cloned repository and start working:
    ```
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

Now you're all set up to work with your GitHub repository on your Mac. You can make changes, commit them, and push them to the remote repository.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
