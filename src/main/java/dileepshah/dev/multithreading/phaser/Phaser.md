The `Phaser` class in Java is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and provides a flexible and reusable synchronization barrier for a variable number of threads. It is an advanced synchronization mechanism that allows threads to wait for each other at a specific point (or phase) and proceed together once all have reached that point. Unlike `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`, `Phaser` can be dynamically adjusted to add or remove parties (threads).

### Real-World Use Case

A real-world use case for `Phaser` could be a multi-stage computation where a set of tasks needs to be performed in phases. For example, in a data processing pipeline, each stage might consist of multiple tasks that need to wait for each other before moving to the next stage. Another example is a simulation where entities perform actions in phases and need to synchronize at the end of each phase.

### How to Use `Phaser` in Java

Below is an example demonstrating how to use `Phaser` in Java. In this example, we simulate a multi-phase task where multiple threads perform some operations in phases and wait for each other at the end of each phase.

#### Example Code

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Phaser;

public class PhaserExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Phaser with the number of parties (threads)
        Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register the main thread

        int numberOfThreads = 3;

        // Create and start threads
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
            new Thread(new Task(phaser, i)).start();
        }

        // Deregister the main thread from the phaser and allow other threads to proceed
        phaser.arriveAndDeregister();

        // Wait for all phases to complete
        while (!phaser.isTerminated()) {
            // Main thread can perform other tasks or just wait
        }

        System.out.println("All phases completed.");
    }
}

class Task implements Runnable {
    private Phaser phaser;
    private int id;

    public Task(Phaser phaser, int id) {
        this.phaser = phaser;
        this.id = id;
        phaser.register(); // Register this thread
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int phase = 0; phase < 3; phase++) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + id + " performing phase " + phase);
            
            // Simulate some work with sleep
            try {
                Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 1000));
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            // Wait for all threads to complete the current phase
            phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
        }

        // Deregister from the phaser
        phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Create a Phaser**: The `Phaser` is created with the number of parties. Here, we start with 1 to register the main thread.
   ```java
   Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1);
   ```

2. **Create and Start Threads**: Multiple threads are created and started. Each thread will perform tasks in multiple phases.
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
       new Thread(new Task(phaser, i)).start();
   }
   ```

3. **Task Class**: Each thread registers with the `Phaser` and performs its task in phases. After completing each phase, it calls `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` to wait for other threads.
   ```java
   class Task implements Runnable {
       private Phaser phaser;
       private int id;

       public Task(Phaser phaser, int id) {
           this.phaser = phaser;
           this.id = id;
           phaser.register();
       }

       @Override
       public void run() {
           for (int phase = 0; phase < 3; phase++) {
               System.out.println("Thread " + id + " performing phase " + phase);
               try {
                   Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 1000));
               } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   e.printStackTrace();
               }
               phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
           }
           phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Deregister Main Thread**: The main thread deregisters itself from the `Phaser` to allow other threads to proceed.
   ```java
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
   ```

5. **Wait for Completion**: The main thread waits for all phases to complete.
   ```java
   while (!phaser.isTerminated()) {
       // Main thread can perform other tasks or just wait
   }
   ```

### Output

When you run this code, you should see output similar to the following, showing each thread performing its tasks in phases and synchronizing at the end of each phase:

```
Thread 0 performing phase 0
Thread 1 performing phase 0
Thread 2 performing phase 0
Thread 0 performing phase 1
Thread 1 performing phase 1
Thread 2 performing phase 1
Thread 0 performing phase 2
Thread 1 performing phase 2
Thread 2 performing phase 2
All phases completed.
```

This demonstrates how to use `Phaser` to coordinate multiple threads performing tasks in phases, ensuring they all synchronize at the end of each phase before proceeding to the next one.
