The `Phaser` class in Java is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and provides a flexible and reusable synchronization barrier for a variable number of threads. It is an advanced synchronization mechanism that allows threads to wait for each other at a specific point (or phase) and proceed together once all have reached that point. Unlike `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`, `Phaser` can be dynamically adjusted to add or remove parties (threads).

### Real-World Use Case

A real-world use case for `Phaser` could be a multi-stage computation where a set of tasks needs to be performed in phases. For example, in a data processing pipeline, each stage might consist of multiple tasks that need to wait for each other before moving to the next stage. Another example is a simulation where entities perform actions in phases and need to synchronize at the end of each phase.
